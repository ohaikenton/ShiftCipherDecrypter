IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, TWO THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS EMERGED FOR FORMULATING THE LAWS OF PHYSICS. THE FIRST IS ALBERT EINSTEIN'S GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY, A THEORY THAT EXPLAINS THE FORCE OF GRAVITY AND THE STRUCTURE OF SPACE AND TIME. THE OTHER IS QUANTUM MECHANICS WHICH IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FORMULATION TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA USING THE KNOWN PROBABILITY PRINCIPLES. BY THE LATE 1970S, THESE TWO FRAMEWORKS HAD PROVEN TO BE SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN MOST OF THE OBSERVED FEATURES OF THE UNIVERSE, FROM ELEMENTARY PARTICLES TO ATOMS TO THE EVOLUTION OF STARS AND THE UNIVERSE AS A WHOLE.IN SPITE OF THESE SUCCESSES, THERE ARE STILL MANY PROBLEMS THAT REMAIN TO BE SOLVED. ONE OF THE DEEPEST PROBLEMS IN MODERN PHYSICS IS THE PROBLEM OF QUANTUM GRAVITY. THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY IS FORMULATED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF CLASSICAL PHYSICS, WHEREAS THE OTHER FUNDAMENTAL FORCES ARE DESCRIBED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF QUANTUM MECHANICS. A QUANTUM THEORY OF GRAVITY IS NEEDED IN ORDER TO RECONCILE GENERAL RELATIVITY WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF QUANTUM MECHANICS, BUT DIFFICULTIES ARISE WHEN ONE ATTEMPTS TO APPLY THE USUAL PRESCRIPTIONS OF QUANTUM THEORY TO THE FORCE OF GRAVITY. IN ADDITION TO THE PROBLEM OF DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT THEORY OF QUANTUM GRAVITY, THERE ARE MANY OTHER FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS IN THE PHYSICS OF ATOMIC NUCLEI, BLACK HOLES, AND THE EARLY UNIVERSE.STRING THEORY IS A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK THAT ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS AND MANY OTHERS. THE STARTING POINT FOR STRING THEORY IS THE IDEA THAT THE POINT-LIKE PARTICLES OF PARTICLE PHYSICS CAN ALSO BE MODELED AS ONE-DIMENSIONAL OBJECTS CALLED STRINGS. STRING THEORY DESCRIBES HOW STRINGS PROPAGATE THROUGH SPACE AND INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER. IN A GIVEN VERSION OF STRING THEORY, THERE IS ONLY ONE KIND OF STRING, WHICH MAY LOOK LIKE A SMALL LOOP OR SEGMENT OF ORDINARY STRING, AND IT CAN VIBRATE IN DIFFERENT WAYS. ON DISTANCE SCALES LARGER THAN THE STRING SCALE, A STRING WILL LOOK JUST LIKE AN ORDINARY PARTICLE, WITH ITS MASS, CHARGE, AND OTHER PROPERTIES DETERMINED BY THE VIBRATIONAL STATE OF THE STRING. IN THIS WAY, ALL OF THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTARY PARTICLES MAY BE VIEWED AS VIBRATING STRINGS. IN STRING THEORY, ONE OF THE VIBRATIONAL STATES OF THE STRING GIVES RISE TO THE GRAVITON, A QUANTUM MECHANICAL PARTICLE THAT CARRIES GRAVITATIONAL FORCE. THUS STRING THEORY IS A THEORY OF QUANTUM GRAVITY.ONE OF THE MAIN DEVELOPMENTS OF THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES IN STRING THEORY WAS THE DISCOVERY OF CERTAIN "DUALITIES", MATHEMATICAL TRANSFORMATIONS THAT IDENTIFY ONE PHYSICAL THEORY WITH ANOTHER. PHYSICISTS STUDYING STRING THEORY HAVE DISCOVERED A NUMBER OF THESE DUALITIES BETWEEN DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF STRING THEORY, AND THIS HAS LED TO THE CONJECTURE THAT ALL CONSISTENT VERSIONS OF STRING THEORY ARE SUBSUMED IN A SINGLE FRAMEWORK KNOWN AS M-THEORY.STUDIES OF STRING THEORY HAVE ALSO YIELDED A NUMBER OF RESULTS ON THE NATURE OF BLACK HOLES AND THE GRAVITATIONAL INTERACTION. THERE ARE CERTAIN PARADOXES THAT ARISE WHEN ONE ATTEMPTS TO UNDERSTAND THE QUANTUM ASPECTS OF BLACK HOLES, AND WORK ON STRING THEORY HAS ATTEMPTED TO CLARIFY THESE ISSUES. IN LATE 1997 THIS LINE OF WORK CULMINATED IN THE DISCOVERY OF THE ANTI-DE SITTER/CONFORMAL FIELD THEORY CORRESPONDENCE OR ADS/CFT. THIS IS A THEORETICAL RESULT WHICH RELATES STRING THEORY TO OTHER PHYSICAL THEORIES WHICH ARE BETTER UNDERSTOOD THEORETICALLY. THE ADS/CFT CORRESPONDENCE HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STUDY OF BLACK HOLES AND QUANTUM GRAVITY, AND IT HAS BEEN APPLIED TO OTHER SUBJECTS, INCLUDING NUCLEAR AND CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS.SINCE STRING THEORY INCORPORATES ALL OF THE FUNDAMENTAL INTERACTIONS, INCLUDING GRAVITY, MANY PHYSICISTS HOPE THAT IT WILL EVENTUALLY FULLY DESCRIBE OUR UNIVERSE, MAKING IT A THEORY OF EVERYTHING. ONE OF THE GOALS OF CURRENT RESEARCH IN STRING THEORY IS TO FIND A SOLUTION OF THE THEORY THAT REPRODUCES THE OBSERVED SPECTRUM OF ELEMENTARY PARTICLES, WITH A SMALL COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT, CONTAINING DARK MATTER AND A PLAUSIBLE MECHANISM FOR COSMIC INFLATION. WHILE THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS TOWARD THESE GOALS, IT IS NOT KNOWN TO WHAT EXTENT STRING THEORY DESCRIBES THE REAL WORLD OR HOW MUCH FREEDOM THE THEORY ALLOWS IN THE CHOICE OF DETAILS.ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF STRING THEORY IS THAT THE FULL THEORY DOES NOT HAVE A SATISFACTORY DEFINITION IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. THE SCATTERING OF STRINGS IS MOST STRAIGHTFORWARDLY DEFINED USING THE TECHNIQUES OF PERTURBATION THEORY, BUT IT IS NOT KNOWN IN GENERAL HOW TO DEFINE STRING THEORY NONPERTURBATIVELY. IT IS ALSO NOT CLEAR WHETHER THERE IS ANY PRINCIPLE BY WHICH STRING THEORY SELECTS ITS VACUUM STATE, THE PHYSICAL STATE THAT DETERMINES THE PROPERTIES OF OUR UNIVERSE. THESE PROBLEMS HAVE LED SOME IN THE COMMUNITY TO CRITICIZE THESE APPROACHES TO THE UNIFICATION OF PHYSICS AND QUESTION THE VALUE OF CONTINUED RESEARCH ON THESE PROBLEMS.THE APPLICATION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS TO PHYSICAL OBJECTS SUCH AS THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD, WHICH ARE EXTENDED IN SPACE AND TIME, IS KNOWN AS QUANT
